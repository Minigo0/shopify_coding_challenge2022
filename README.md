# shopify_coding_challenge2022
In this repository, you can find 3 things:

- A PDF containing my answers to the conding challenge given by Shopify for the 2022 Data Internship;
- A R-script that contains the manipulations made on the 2022 Data set to reach the answers from the PDF's Question 1;
- And the data set as a .csv file, which I used to write the code from the R-script.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
